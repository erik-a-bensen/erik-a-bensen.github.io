I am a first year Ph.D. Student in the department of [Statistics and Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) at Carnegie Mellon. I am broadly interested in the theoretical foundations of non-classical Statistics, applications of Statistics to the Physical Sciences as well as Explainability and Fairness in Machine Learning; however, I have not yet direction to pursue for my Ph.D. research.

Before joining CMU, I was a Computational Scientist at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov) (NREL) where I worked on understanding and reducing the energy consumption of deep learning models, mitigating socioeconomic biases in energy consumption models and state estimation problems for Traffic Controls Systems.

I graduated with my M.S. in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and my B.S. in Engineering Physics from [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu) where I was a [Harvey Scholar](https://www.mines.edu/pascal/harvey-scholars/). Before my masters, I worked in Materials Science as a part of the [Toberer Lab Group](https://people.mines.edu/etoberer/).

Outside of research I am an avid traveler, I enjoy climbing and backpacking, I am a classical pianist, and I am a member of the International Shotokan Karate Federation (ISKF) where I hold a first degree black belt.
